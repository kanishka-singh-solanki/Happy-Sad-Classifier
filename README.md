# Happy-Sad-Classifier

# 1. Dataset Preparation
Before building any model, you'd typically need a dataset of images labeled as 'happy' or 'sad'. This dataset is then divided into training, validation, and test sets.

# 2. CNN Architecture
A typical CNN architecture for such a task might look like:

Input Layer: Accepts the image data (e.g., 128x128 pixels).

Convolutional Layers: These layers apply convolutional filters to the input data to extract features.

Filters: Start with a small size (e.g., 3x3) and increase the size in deeper layers.
Activation: After each convolutional layer, a ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function might be applied to introduce non-linearity.
Pooling Layers: These layers reduce the spatial size of the representation to decrease the computational complexity and to control overfitting.

Commonly used pooling methods include MaxPooling.
Flatten Layer: Converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector to be fed into a fully connected layer.

Fully Connected (Dense) Layers: These are traditional neural network layers.

The first fully connected layer can have a large number of neurons (e.g., 128 or 256) with a ReLU activation.
The final output layer usually has two neurons (one for 'happy' and one for 'sad') with a softmax activation to provide probability scores for each class.
Dropout: To reduce overfitting, you might introduce dropout layers after the fully connected layers.

# 3. Model Compilation and Training
Once the architecture is defined, the model needs to be compiled with appropriate loss function, optimizer, and metrics. A common choice for binary classification problems is the binary cross-entropy loss.

The model is then trained on the training data using an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam) and monitored using the validation data.

# 4. Evaluation
After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test set to determine its accuracy and other relevant metrics.

# 5. Prediction
Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict whether a given face image is happy or sad.
